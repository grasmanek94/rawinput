This project is dedicated to bringing the RawInput API to C++, simplifying its usage.

If not used directly, at least anyone can see its implementation and have their questions answered before they even ask.

Of course, the best would be to have many users contribute their knowledge and experience, everyone is welcome.

Please take a look at the project's wiki, all the necessary info on how to get you started should be in there.
